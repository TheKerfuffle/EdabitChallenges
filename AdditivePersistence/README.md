The additive persistence of an integer, n, is the number of times you have to replace n with the sum of its digits until n becomes a single digit integer.

Examples: Additive Persistence

additivePersistence(1679583) ➞ 3
// 1 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 5 + 8 + 3 = 39
// 3 + 9 = 12
// 1 + 2 = 3
// It takes 3 iterations to reach a single-digit number.

additivePersistence(123456) ➞ 2
// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
// 2 + 1 = 3

additivePersistence(6) ➞ 0
// Because 6 is already a single-digit integer.
